    "content": "Life as we know it has undergone a technological transformation from physical formats to more efficient digital formats. Photographs that used to take hours to develop only take seconds to send across the world today. This digital transformation has revolutionized virtually everything we interact with in the modern world, yet seemingly have left private equity behind. Public stocks have gone digital, but with a catch. When you buy stock through a brokerage, the stock is held in “book entry” form. Rather than keep track of each individual shareholder, stocks are registered “in street name” to a brokerage account, and the broker maintains a ledger of internal transactions between investors.In order to simplify these transactions (which ironically makes it more complicated), most public stock is registered to a single brokerage named Cede & Co (a nominee of the Depository Trust Company, DTC), and brokerages have their own accounts in book entry form with them. Think you really own the stock you just bought? In reality, what you bought is an “I owe you” of your broker’s “I owe you” from the DTC. For private equity markets, the problem lies in a lack of digitally certifiable technology which allows investors to verify the authenticity of the assets they are purchasing. Private assets are not controlled by a centralized authority like the NYSE, and are traditionally issued as paper shares locked away in personal safes, or recorded on a lawyer’s computer as an excel file. Simply taking a certificate and issuing a digital file in its place creates a plethora of major issues."
